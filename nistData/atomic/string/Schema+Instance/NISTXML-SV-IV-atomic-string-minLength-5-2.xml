Extensible Stylesheet Language  XSL  defines methods for transforming
and displaying XML documents on a variety of devices  from web browsers

Virtually all application domains are looking
to use XML technologies to define  manipulate  and exchange structured
information  In addition  XML processors and support for the related
Schema  DOM and XSL technologies are available in beta versions of
popular web browsers and application development software  The
widespread availability of these technologies has made them obvious
choices as building blocks for electronic commerce  As such  conformance
of these products to the W3C Recommendations is necessary to build
interoperable solutions  The Organization for the Advancement of
