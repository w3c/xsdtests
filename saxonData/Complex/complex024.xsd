  <!-- Not an error. As a result of (XSD 1.1 part 1) 
    section 3.4.2.3.3 Mapping Rules for Content Type Property of Complex Content,
    the {content type} of the derived type is `mixed`, so it behaves as if
    mixed='true' were explicitly specified on the derived type. -->
  
  <!-- Specifically, the mapping rules for {content type} of the derived type are as follows:
      Rule 1: `effective mixed` is false
      Rule 2: `explicit content` is empty
      Rule 3: `effective content` is empty
      Rule 4: (4.2.2) {Content Type|} is {base type definition}.{content type} which has variety `mixed`.
      Therefore both complex type components have {variety}=mixed, so there is no conflict.
